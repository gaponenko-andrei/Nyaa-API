1. Searching functionality: creating request, getting response.
    Things to thing about:
    - Rq/Rs entities.
    - Filter construction.
    - Search api interface.
    - TDD?
    - Remote Data Source in 'main' directory
        - base url' list - https://nyaa.si mainly blocked by internet providers,
          so we need to have a list of backup base urls to access the site.

            - create a simple .config (text) file and take
              those base url and populate data source with them

            - caching functionality - if base url works, then we use continue to use it
